# ðŸš€ CodeHawks First Flight ðŸ¦…

Welcome to my **CodeHawks First Flight** repository! This repository contains my solutions and detailed analyses of the **CodeHawks First Flight** challenges from Cyfrin. The First Flight challenges are designed to help beginners dive into the world of **smart contract auditing**, providing hands-on experience with real-world security flaws and vulnerabilities.

## ðŸŽ¯ Whatâ€™s Inside?
Each challenge has its own dedicated folder, containing:
- âœ… **Smart contract source code** (from the challenge)
- âœ… **Test cases and exploit scripts** used during the process
- âœ… A detailed **README** explaining the contract
- âœ… A **Vulnerabilities.md** listing and explaining the vulnerabilities I've discovered
